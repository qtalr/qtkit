The goal of `qtkit` is to provide a support package for the textbook
[“An Introduction to Quantitative Text Analysis for Linguistics:
Reproducible Research using R”](https://qtalr.github.io/book/). It
contains functions for collecting and manipulating data and datasets,
documentation, and other assorted tasks associated with quantitative
text analysis in R.

## Getting started

You can install the released version of `qtkit` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("qtkit")
```

The development version of `qtkit` is on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
and can be installed with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("qtalr/qtkit")
```

Then load the package with:

``` r
library(qtkit)
```
