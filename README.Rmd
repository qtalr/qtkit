The goal of `qtkit` is to provide a support package for the textbook ["An Introduction to Quantitative Text Analysis for Linguistics: Reproducible Research using R"](https://qtalr.com/book/). It contains functions for collecting and manipulating data and datasets, documentation, and other assorted tasks associated with quantitative text analysis in R.

## Getting started

You can install the released version of `qtkit` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qtkit) with:

```r
install.packages("qtkit")
```

The development version of `qtkit` is on [GitHub](https://github.com/qtalr/qtkit) and can be installed with:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("qtalr/qtkit")
```

Then load the package with:

```r
library(qtkit)
```

Please consult the [package documentation](https://qtalr.com/qtkit/reference/) for more information.
