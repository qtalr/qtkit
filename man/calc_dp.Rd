\title{Calculate Gries' Deviation of Proportions}
\usage{
calc_dp(tdm)
}
\arguments{
\item{tdm}{A term-document matrix}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of normalized DP values for each term
}
\description{
Computes the Deviation of Proportions (DP) measure developed by Stefan Th. Gries.
DP measures how evenly distributed a term is across all parts of the corpus.
The normalized version (DP_norm) is returned, which ranges from 0 (evenly distributed)
to 1 (extremely clumped distribution).
